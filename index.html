        <P>
          Sometimes I feel as if there are just not enough hours in a day, but when I get some free time there are three things I enjoy doing. One of which is painting. Somehow I manage to create some decent acrylic paintings, just don't ask me to draw you anything with a pencil the best you would get out of me is a smiley face.  Reading is another big interest of mine. I prefer nonfiction but every now and then I mix it up. Some of my favorites reads are <i>Start With Why</i> <sup>1</sup> <i>Who Moved My Cheese</i><sup>2</sup> and <i>The Forty Rules of Love</i><sup>3</sup>. Then of course there is the gym. I must say that the gym is more of a necessity to compensate for my true interest which is to eat. Well cook and eat key word here is <b>eat</b>.
