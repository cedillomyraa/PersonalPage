        Hi! My name is Maira Quinones. I have lived in Denver, Colorado for about six years. I was born in Dallas, Texas and moved to Tampa, Florida when I turned fifteen years old. I would have to say although scary and stressful it was a much needed move. I graduated high school and didn't have a set direction as to where I wanted to take my life. So I joined the Navy and was stationed in Virginia. I was lucky enough to earn a position in the Joint Forces Flag Staff Team. The Flag <ins>aka</ins> <small>spoiled community to many. </small> <mark>Flag Staff Community team is a small community within the Navy that works with the higher chain of command.</mark> SO yes I was lucky and my experience was amazing. After the Navy I moved back to Florida where I earned my degree in Legal Studies, I never pursued a career in the field although I loved it to the core. I moved to Colorado in 2016 where I then began a career in Education. I taught multiple levels from 2nd to 8th graders. My favorite grades were middle school. Due to COVID I moved and decided to teach privately and that is what I currently do. <b></b>

        I am a mom to a wonderful eleven year old girl. Who would live in water if she had a choice. I have two younger siblings who are close to me. I have moved them around with me but they have finally decided to make Colorado home for themselves. Most of my family still live in Texas or Mexico. <del> It has been years since I have visited either place.</del> <b></b>

        Why software development for me? I have friends in the field and truly it's how my interest grew. I decided to take the step to pursue it to change my career permanently as I see a vast of avenues a career in software development can bring. <b></b>

        <P>
          Sometimes I feel as if there are just not enough hours in a day, but when I get some free time there are three things I enjoy doing. One of which is painting. Somehow I manage to create some decent acrylic paintings, just don't ask me to draw you anything with a pencil the best you would get out of me is a smiley face.  Reading is another big interest of mine. I prefer nonfiction but every now and then I mix it up. Some of my favorites reads are <i>Start With Why</i> <sup>1</sup> <i>Who Moved My Cheese</i><sup>2</sup> and <i>The Forty Rules of Love</i><sup>3</sup>. Then of course there is the gym. I must say that the gym is more of a necessity to compensate for my true interest which is to eat. Well cook and eat key word here is <b>eat</b>.
